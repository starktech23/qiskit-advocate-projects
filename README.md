# qiskit-advocate-projects
A repository of projects that Qiskit Advocates are actively working on

## I have an idea I want to work on
Open an issue using the [`new advocate project template`](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-advocate-projects/issues/new?assignees=&labels=help+wanted&template=new-advocate-project-template.md&title=Project+name) template.

## Working Schedule Template
This is only a suggested schedule that you can try out and see if this helps with consistent progress on your projects in a more organized manner, communicate better with teammates and focus on your project here for short bursts of time so that these projects and your work commitments don't interfere with each other..... very much like a hackathon. </br> </br>
This template is inspired by the fast-paced time-table of Qiskit Hackathons, bringing in the same collaborative spirit but also flexible as per your teams' and projects' needs, so make a copy and consider usage and modifications accordingly. The idea is to have all Advocates work on their problems of interest at the same time so that everyone is also online at the same time, making it easier to reach out for discussions and help recreating a hackathon experience.

| Time (UTC 0) | Activity  |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 12:00 - 14:00 | Hacking Session 1 |
| 14:00 - 14:15 | Break 1 |
| 14:15 - 16:00 | Hacking Session 2 |
| 16:00 - 16:15 | Break 2 |
| 16:15 - 18:00 | Hacking Session 3 |

### Recommended schedule guidelines:
- Each weekend, both days (Saturday, Sunday).
- The timings here are all in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC 0) so make sure to convert to your own as well as teammates' time zones accordingly.
- Timings here are suggested so that all time zones are covered and maximum number of Advocates are active in that duration, but this is flexible according to team availability and you should consider shifting it to more comfortable time slots if needed.
- Connect via Slack DM call (or other platforms like a Discord server if you prefer something else).
- Recommended 30 mins break, can take and split over any time. 
- Can extend hack time but be mindful of own and teammates' schedules.
- Consider working on higher priority/closer to completion projects first if you're assigned to multiple projects. Exercise self-discretion and inform teammates in advance.
